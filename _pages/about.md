I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), where I have the privilege of being advised by Andrew Quinn. My research focuses on cutting-edge hardware and software co-design, aiming to accelerate data access and manipulation on modern heterogeneous architectures for a wide range of workloads. I am particularly interested in the application of CXL technology to improve performance across various industries. Prior to joining UCSC, I was pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Missouri, where my research centered on computer architecture and machine learning. The transfer to UCSC has allowed me to further explore the fascinating intersection of these fields and contribute to the development of innovative solutions that drive technological advancements..
